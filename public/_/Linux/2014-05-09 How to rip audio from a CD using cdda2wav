# 2014-05-09 How to rip audio from a CD using cdda2wav

This text is based on Cygwin + Windows.

## Finding the CDRom

Run:

```
cdda2wav --scanbus
```

In the output, look for something like this:

```html
2,0,0   200) 'TSSTcorp' 'CDDVDW SH-S223Q ' 'SB01' Removable CD-ROM
```

Look for the numbers (2,0,0) - you'll need them.

It's also possible to run "cdda2wav dev=help" for more information

## Ripping to wav

Run

```
cdda2wav -cddb=0 -device=2,0,0 --alltracks
```

* *cddb* will automatically rename the tracks correctly (if possible)
* device=the numbers from the above step
* alltracks = rip entire cd

Output will stored in the current directory.
